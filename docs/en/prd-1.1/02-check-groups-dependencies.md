§2 defines how the `email` category is put together: which groups the checks fall into, which of them depend on `MX`, and what happens to each group when the domain has no mail server. The responsible section for status and dependency semantics is 1.0 §7; only their application to this category is defined here.

## 2.1. Three Groups

```text
Email Authentication
├─ SPF
├─ DMARC
└─ DKIM

Inbound Mail
├─ MX
└─ STARTTLS

Mail Server
└─ PTR
```

The groups are not categories of their own and carry no verdict: they are units of dependency inside one category.

## 2.2. Why the Groups Are Separate

`SPF`, `DMARC` and `DKIM` are policies of the sending domain, published as `TXT` records. They exist whether or not the domain receives mail: `v=spf1 -all` on a domain that neither sends nor receives is not a mistake but a correct declaration.

`STARTTLS` and `PTR` describe one specific server. That server is determined by the domain's records, and where there is none these checks have no subject — the answer is not unknown, there is nothing to ask about.

## 2.3. What Counts as a Receiving Server

No `MX` does not mean mail has nowhere to go. RFC 7505 describes the order laid down by RFC 5321: finding no `MX`, a sender turns to the domain's own address records. Such a server is called implicit, and the checks of the receiving server do have a subject.

There is no subject in two cases:

| State of the domain | Value of `blockedBy` |
|---|---|
| neither `MX` nor address records | `mx_missing` |
| an `MX` published to say "I accept no mail" | `null_mx` |

The second is a deliberate declaration by the owner under RFC 7505, not an omission. Both are detailed in §6.

## 2.4. When There Is No Subject

| Check | Status |
|---|---|
| `SPF` | runs as usual |
| `DMARC` | runs as usual |
| `DKIM` | runs as usual |
| `STARTTLS` | `NOT_APPLICABLE` with `blockedBy` |
| `PTR` | `NOT_APPLICABLE` with `blockedBy` |

`NOT_APPLICABLE` rather than `UNKNOWN`: `UNKNOWN` means the check applies but no result could be obtained, whereas here the subject of the check is absent.

The state of the domain is scored once, by the `MX` check. The checks it blocks add no further penalty; otherwise one cause would penalise the domain four times over. How `NOT_APPLICABLE` affects confidence is defined in 1.0 §11 and is unchanged here.

## 2.5. The Receiving Server, Not Outbound Mail

`MX` names the server that **receives** mail for the domain. The server the domain **sends** from may be a different one, and it does not follow from the domain's public records.

The results of `PTR` are therefore stated as the condition of the receiving server. Claims such as "mail from this domain will land in spam" are not permitted on this evidence: they rest on a link the data does not contain. The general rule against unproven causal claims is 1.0 §13.

## 2.6. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-2.1** The `SPF`, `DMARC` and `DKIM` checks run whether or not `MX` is present.
- **AC-2.2** With no `MX` but with address records for the domain, the checks of the receiving server run against the implicit server.
- **AC-2.3** Where there is no subject, the `STARTTLS` and `PTR` checks return `NOT_APPLICABLE` with a `blockedBy` drawn from the values `mx_missing` and `null_mx`.
- **AC-2.4** An absent receiving server gives no check in the category the status `UNKNOWN`.
- **AC-2.5** The state of the receiving server reduces the numerical score once, through the result of the `MX` check.
- **AC-2.6** The messages of the `PTR` check describe the receiving server and assert nothing about the domain's outbound mail.
