§1 defines what release 1.1 adds, what stays outside it, and how it relates to the frozen MVP 1.0 specification.

## 1.1. What the Release Adds

One category of checks:

```text
email
```

Its contents:

```text
SPF
DMARC
DKIM
MX
STARTTLS
PTR
DNSBL
```

The category takes part in a full scan alongside `dns`, `registry` and `tls`, and is available as a separate tool.

## 1.2. What the Release Does Not Do

Outside the boundary:

- assessing the reputation of the mail a domain sends;
- receiving, parsing and delivering messages;
- verifying the signature on an individual message;
- advice on configuring a particular mail provider beyond what the published records state.

The reason for the first item is substantive rather than organisational: outbound reputation belongs to the address a domain sends from, and that address does not follow from the domain's public records — see §2.

## 1.3. Relation to MVP 1.0

This document does not change the checks in the `dns`, `registry` and `tls` categories. Behaviour defined in 1.0 is extended in four places:

| Responsible 1.0 section | What is extended | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1.0 §7 | category semantics | §2 |
| 1.0 §11 | summary and verdict | §11 |
| 1.0 §12 | numerical score | §11 |
| 1.0 §15 | outbound connection safety | §14 |

Each extension names the responsible 1.0 section and does not rewrite it.

## 1.4. Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-1.1** The release adds exactly one category, `email`; the checks in the `dns`, `registry` and `tls` categories are unchanged.
- **AC-1.2** This document does not amend the text of MVP 1.0; in a conflict, the provision in the responsible section identified in Appendix A applies.
- **AC-1.3** Outbound mail reputation is outside the release boundary and is not inferred from the results of the `email` category.
- **AC-1.4** Receiving, parsing and delivering messages are outside the release boundary.
- **AC-1.5** The `email` category is available both in a full scan and as a separate tool.
